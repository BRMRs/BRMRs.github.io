I'm a second year undergraduate student from [ICS](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/undergraduate/information-and-computing-science), [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en). 

My research interest includes natural language processing, Large Language Model, machine learning, and LLM Agent.
